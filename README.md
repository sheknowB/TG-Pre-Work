## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

The browser goes to the DNS server and looks up the IP address of the server where the website resides. The browser then sends an HTTP request message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. If the server approves it sends the client an OK message and then starts sending the data in little chunks, known as data packets. The browser assembles the data packets into a complete website and displays it in the browser.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

A user types a URL into the address bar of a browser. The browser parses the URL to find the protocol, host, and path. To reach the host the domain name needs to be interpreted into an IP address. The browser then looks up the IP address through the Domain Name System (DNS). The browser then sends an HTTP request. The host then makes the connection with the server and sends the request. The server receives the request, searches for the data and sends the response back to the browser. The browser then displays the data retrieved.
