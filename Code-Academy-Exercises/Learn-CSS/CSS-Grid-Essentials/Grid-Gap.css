/* In this exercise we explore the grid-gap properties. Grid-column-gap sets the gap between columns, grid-row-gap sets the gap between rows. */
/* Grid-gap combines both properties, where the first value sets the gap between rows and the second value for columns. If there is just a single value it will be applied to both rows and columns. */
