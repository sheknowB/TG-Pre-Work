/* In a typical loop, there is an iterator variable which appears in all three expressions of a loop. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration.
A for loop contains three expressions:
  1. Initialization. starts the loop and can be used to declare the iteration variable.
  2. Stopping Condition. The condition that the iterator variable is checked against. If the condition value is true the code keeps running, false the code stops.
  3. Iteration Statement. Used to update the iterator variable on each loop.
