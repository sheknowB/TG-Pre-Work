// Write your code below
const vacationSpots = ['Australia', 'Azores', 'Monaco'];//Create an array of places you would like to visit
console.log(vacationSpots[0]);
console.log(vacationSpots[1]);
console.log(vacationSpots[2]);

//Repeating code manually is cumbersome and time consuming, not to mention boring.
