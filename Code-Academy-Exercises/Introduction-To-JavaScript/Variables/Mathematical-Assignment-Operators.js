/* We learn that you can combine variables with mathematical operations to calculate new values and assign them to a variable.
  There is also a shorthand way of applying the mathematical operation by using mathematical assignment operators.
  For instance if we wanted to add two values we would use the += operator, or if we wanted to multiply we would use the *= operator. */
