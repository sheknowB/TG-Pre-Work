/* JavaScript modules are reuseable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program.

   By seperating code into modules we can:
    - find, fix, and debug code more easily
    - reuse and recycle defined logic in different parts of our application
    - keep information private and protected from other modules
    - prevent pollution of the global namescape and potential naming collisions
