/*Comparison operators compare two values and outputs a boolean value. It is best to think of them as a question.
  We use comparison operators to evaluate these values. Comparison operators compare the value on the left to the value on the right and then outputs a true or false.
  Some comparison operators are:
    < - Less than
    > - Greater than
    <= - Less than or equal to
    >= - Greater or equal to
    === - Is Equal to
    !== - Is Not equal to
