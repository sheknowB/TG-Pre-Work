/* There are operators that work with boolean values called logical operators.
  There are three logical operators:

    1. The and operator (&&)
    2. The or operator (||)
    3. The not operator (!) also known as the bang operator

  When we use the && operator both conditions must evaluate to true for the entire condition to evaluate true.
  When we use the || operator just one of the conditions must evaluate to true for the entire condition to evalute true.
  The ! operator negates the value of a boolean.
