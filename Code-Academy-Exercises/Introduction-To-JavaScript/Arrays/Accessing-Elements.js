/* As mentioned in the previous exercise, elements have a numbered position within an Array. These positions are known as indexes. We can access an element according to its index.
  Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is index 0.
  You can also access individual characters in a string using bracket notation and the index.
