var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = 'You can make carbonara with '+ pasta +', ' + meat +', and a sauce made with ' + sauce +'.';

/* Three reasons for the ES5 -> ES6 update
  1.  JavaScript ES6 is syntactically more similar to other object-oriented programming languages, making it easier for non-JavaScript programmers to learn JavaScript.
  2.  Readability and economy of code. easier to understand, and can do more in less characters.
  3.  Addresses sources of ES5 bugs.

  To limit the impact of ES6 browser compatibility issues, Ecma made the new syntax backwards compatible.
