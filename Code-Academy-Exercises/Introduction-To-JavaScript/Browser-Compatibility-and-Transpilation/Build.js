/* After writing the "build" script into the package.json we can call "build" from the command line to transpile and write ES5 code to a directory called lib.

   From the command line we write: npm run build
   This runs the build script in package.json. Babel writes the ES5 code to a file named main.js inside of a folder called lib.

  The npm run build command will transpile all JavaScript files inside of the src folder.
  You will only need to run the npm run build command once to transpile all of your code.
