/* Objects can be assigned to variables. We use curly brackets {} to designate object literal. We fill an object with unordered data. This data is organized into key-value pairs. The key is like a variable name that points to a location in memory that holds a value.
  To make a key-value pair we write the key's name (identifier), followed by a colon and then the value. We separate key-value pairs by a comma.
